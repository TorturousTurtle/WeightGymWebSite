        content: "I&apos;ve been picking up iron objects and putting them down for something like 15 years now. Max joined me on my gym battles a few years back, so you could say we&apos;ve got a little bit of experience when it comes to good ol&apos; fashion weight lifting.<br><br>I&apos;ve been in the gym with all types of people; from super serious gym-atical, juiced up lunkheads to your “there in January, gone by February” gym goer.  Both extremes bothered me because there&apos;s nothing worse than working out in a room full people who either take themselves too seriously, or worse, those that don&apos;t take it seriously at all. Yeah I love working out.  Yeah I love trying to be healthy.  But my world doesn&apos;t revolve around it and it&apos;s not the only thing in my life, just an enjoyable part.  And I know I&apos;m not the only person who thinks this way.<br><br>And that&apos;s who we made Weight Gym! for.   The person who enjoys going to the gym multiple times a week. The person who loves the feel of that pump you get when they&apos;re pushing their body to new limits. Those who love breaking their own personal bests, and seeing the changes their hard work has gained them.The people who aren&apos;t trying to be IFBB pros, who don&apos;t want to eat 5 meals a day (though honestly, it&apos;s not all that bad!), and aren&apos;t pumping their bodies full of chemicals to become unnatural monsters.<br><br>We have fun at the gym. We crack jokes between sets. We grunt and sweat and sometimes smell bad. We make new friends and encourage each other to be better. That&apos;s why Max and I started this company. We wanted to embrace that fun, hard working spirit of those people at all stages of their fitness development, and give them something fun to motivate them on their journey.<br><br>We&apos;re going to have a lot of fun.  I&apos;ll be writing more articles, workout plans, and even hosting a podcast.  I can&apos;t wait to see where this crazy idea takes us.  I&apos;ll see you guys at the gym, and as always, Less Thinkin&apos; and More Healthin&apos;!<br><br>-BV",

Because I&apos;m an impatient American, I want to get the best results the fast way I can with the least amount of effort.

This seems redundant but many people try to take on changing their diet, increasing their physical activity, and being more mentally fit all at once.
