        <b>Cookies</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as
        anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the

        <br />
        <br />
        I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following

        <br />I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties
        have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the
        tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
        disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
        <b>Security</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we
        are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But
        remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of
