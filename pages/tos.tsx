        By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to
        you. You should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before
        using the app. You&apos;re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any
        part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You&apos;re not allowed
        to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also
        shouldn&apos;t try to translate the app into other languages, or make
        derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
        database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it,
        still belong to Benjamin Verrill. <br />

        Benjamin Verrill is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and
        efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make
        changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for
        any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without
        making it very clear to you exactly what you&apos;re paying for. <br />
        <br />
        The Weight Gym! app stores and processes personal data that you have
        provided to us, in order to provide my Service. It&apos;s your
        responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We
        therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which
        is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed
        by the official operating system of your device. It could make your
        phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your
        phone&apos;s security features and it could mean that the Weight Gym!
        app won&apos;t work properly or at all. <br />

        The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and
        Conditions. <br />

        You should be aware that there are certain things that Benjamin Verrill
        will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will
        require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection
        can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Benjamin
        Verrill cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
        functionality if you don&apos;t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don&apos;t
        have any of your data allowance left. <br />
        <br />
        If you&apos;re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
        remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network
        provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
        mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection
        while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app,
        you&apos;re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including
        roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
        (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are
        not the bill payer for the device on which you&apos;re using the app,
        please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from
        the bill payer for using the app. <br />
        <br />
        Along the same lines, Benjamin Verrill cannot always take responsibility
        for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device
        stays charged. If it runs out of battery and you can&apos;t turn it on
        to avail the Service, Benjamin Verrill cannot accept responsibility.{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        With respect to Benjamin Verrill&apos;s responsibility for your use of
        the app, when you&apos;re using the app, it&apos;s important to bear in
        mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct
        at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us
        so that we can make it available to you. Benjamin Verrill accepts no
        liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result
        of relying wholly on this functionality of the app. <br />
        <br />
        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
        available on iOS. The requirements for system(and for any additional
        systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
        and you&apos;ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using
        the app. Benjamin Verrill does not promise that it will always update
        the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS version
        that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always
        accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish
        to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time
        without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you
        otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to
        you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if
        needed) delete it from your device. <br />
        <br />

        are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will
