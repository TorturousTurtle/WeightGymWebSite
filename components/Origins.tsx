        Weight Gym! Is about having fun and laughing while still being serious
        about challenging yourself and being healthy. It started when Max, a
        total workout novice, and Ben, a lapsed gym enthusiast, challenged each
        other to improve our health while still balancing busy jobs and
        relationships. As we grew more passionate about working out, we found
        gym clothing to be way too serious for our tastes. So we figured the
        best way to solve that issue was make our own clothing and if we felt
        that way, others did too.
        <br />
        <br />
        We work out hard and get loud in the gym. We grunt, we laugh, and we
        think the gym is a place of less thinkin&apos;, and more healthin&apos;!
